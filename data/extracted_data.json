            "Do you think the UN definition of genocide should be revised? I'm sure you're aware of the Soviet Union's role in keeping class factors out of the definition, which means on the face of it, the Cambodian Genocide didn't meet the definition (although political factors means it was defined as such later). Also the 'in part' issue - that surely makes the definition incredibly broad as to become almost useless?",
            "I'm curious about what things you see that give you hope for America these days?\n\nThe more I pay attention the more parallels I see to really bad situations in history (the leadup to Nazi party rule, the kind of language used around multiple genocides, the exponential rate of growth in misinformation/AI/deepfake stuff, etc).  And I find myself getting quite bogged down in these things and getting more and more worried.  So what, if anything, gives you a sense of hope and optimism that America can survive and thrive in the face of things like Project 2025, political polarization, and radicalization?",
            "Hello, thanks for doing this. As someone interested in anthropology myself, it's good to see anthropologists out there!\n\nI'm wondering what your thoughts are on the relationship between far-right extremist ideology and religious fundamentalism in the US, especially the heavy focus on the eschatological elements of American Christianity. Some parts of the QAnon movement certainly echo some variety of messianism, and that's basically never gone well for anyone involved.",
            "It seems to me that a lot the reasons that people give for their opinions are confabulation.  It's not that they are lying, rather it is that don't actually know why they believe what they believe.\n\nI'll give two examples.  Trump supporters say that the Trump is the legitimate president because election fraud result in an illegitimate win for President Biden.  But this is not actually why they think the election is illegitimate.  \n\nTrump supporters believe the election was stolen because Trump won the white vote.  In their \"tacit\" view, America is a white country and \"real\" Americans are white.  If the winner of the presidential election did not get a majority of votes from \"real\" Americans, the vote cannot be legitimate.  \n\nI think that this logic is largely unconscious.  Almost like our tacit knowledge of grammar produces a sentence without our necessarily understanding why the words are arranged as they are, our unconscious ideas about race and identity produce results we then confabulate reasons for.\n\nA second example is abortion.  Abortion opponents claim that person-hood is established at the moment of conception, and this is why abortion should be a crime.  But this is not the reasoning that they actually use, as the IVF case shows.  IVF inevitably produces unusable fertilized eggs that must eventually be destroyed, but abortion opponents are in favor of allowing this to happen but not abortion on demand. Why?\n\nThe difference between the cases is the intention of the mother, not the professed person-status of the fetus.  IVF involves women who want to be mothers, while most abortions cases are the reverse.  Anti-abortion efforts are meant to target (punish) women who are sexually active but do not want to  be mothers.  So IVF is okay, but abortion on demand is not, and the person-hood of the fetus doesn't enter into it all.\n\nI raise the question of coherence in political reasoning because I suspect that political reasoning is, in fact, coherent, even if the reasons people give are not.  This is relevant to the question of political violence and extremism because we often rationalize violence and extremism with incoherent arguments.  \n\nUnmasking the tacit beliefs that underpin political violence could be one means of pushing back against it because the tacit reasons are tacit *for* a reason. The tacit reasons are in some way ego-alien and threaten the coherence of the person's identity by conflicting with other beliefs. And that could force a change.",
            "What role does egalatarianism play in the formetting of extremism?\u00a0\n\n\nEverytime an AMA comes up from a reporter or news org and they are asked about why they go so easy on extremists, their response is something to the effect of \"we are reporting news as it happens and both sides deserve equal representation\".\u00a0\n\n\nI find this to be a cop out and bullshit. For example, a new organization running a story about if climate change is man made. On air they will have one guy for and one against. In the papers it will be an opinion article for and an opinion article against. This does not reflect the actual consensus on the topic when 97% of the experts in the field believe climate change is man made. Presenting the topic as equal does no favours to their viewers.\u00a0\n\n\n> Anti-intellectualism \u2026 first got its strong grip on our ways of thinking because it was fostered by an evangelical religion that also purveyed many humane and democratic sentiments. It made its way into our politics because it became associated with our passion for equality. It has become formidable in our education partly because our educational beliefs are evangelically egalitarian. Hence, as far as possible, our anti-intellectualism must be excised from the benevolent impulses upon which it lives by constant and delicate acts of intellectual surgery which spare these impulses themselves.\nRichard Hofstadter, Anti-Intellectualism in American Life (1963), pp. 22-23",
            "It seems strange to me that while Americans feel (and are told we are) more and more extremely polarized in our political differences, at the same time the country seems very evenly divided between the two positions/parties.

            "i'm wondering if you see a connection in the rise of extremism in america to political gaslighting and mental illness.  i read an article in \"psychology today\" several years ago that cited a survey of psychiatrists who estimated that 1 in 4 americans were clinically paranoid, which was a marked increase.  at the time, another unrelated survey found that 25% of the population self identified as republican.  \n\ni contacted the writer of the article, a psychiatrist who's name i can no longer recall and asked if they were seeing any evidence of, or if they suspected, that one political party was gaslighting it's base with fear-mongering, and if so, could that party be making it's base clinically paranoid.  he answered that they were seeing a connection but that for ethical reasons, they couldn't come right out and say it.  since then (this was approximately 17 yrs ago) i feel i see a connection between mental illness (especially paranoia) and the drastic rise in extremism.  do you feel that one political party has been targeting the mentally ill and could be largely responsible for the rise in extremism?  and if so, do you see anyway in your studies for this to be reversed."

But when a court reduced the bond to $175 million last week and Trump said he had the cash to post it himself, the matter seemed moot, Hankey told The Washington Post.\n\nThen, to his surprise, the Trump team last week revived the talks and asked Hankey if he would back the new amount. Hankey promptly agreed. He said that his company is charging Trump a \u201cmodest fee,\u201d which he declined to disclose, and that the arrangement allowed Trump to hold onto his money, adding, \u201cAt least he\u2019s getting interest on his collateral.\u201d\n\nWith\u00a0[the bond,\u00a0which Trump posted Monday](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/04/01/trump-new-york-bond-175-million/?itid=lk_inline_manual_8), Hankey appears to have facilitated a final step in Trump\u2019s narrow escape from a cash crunch that a few weeks ago had the New York attorney general vowing to come after his assets and experts wondering if he would have to file for bankruptcy as he faced more than half a billion dollars in penalties from two civil cases, with only weeks to find the money.\n\nThe financial boost for the presumed GOP nominee has thrust Hankey into the midst of a presidential campaign, bringing a new national profile to a colorful 80-year-old worth $7.4 billion, according to Forbes, who worked his way from car salesman to major player in the car loan industry and owner of Xanadu, formerly Olivia Newton-John\u2019s Malibu estate.
